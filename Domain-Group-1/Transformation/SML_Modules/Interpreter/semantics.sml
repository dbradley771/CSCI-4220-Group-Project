(* Here is where you add the M and E (as well as any other) definitions you developed in M2. The primary challenge here
   is to translate the parse expression notation we used in M2 to the actual SML tree patterns used in the TL System. 
   
   Example:
   
   M1: <stmtList> ::= <stmt> ";" <stmList>
   
   M2: M( [[ stmt_1 ; stmtList_1 ]], m) = M(stmtList_1, M(stmt_1,m))
    
   M4: 
        M( itree(inode("stmtList",_),
                    [
                        stmt,       (* this is a regular variable in SML and has no other special meaning *)
                        semiColon,  (* this is a regular variable in SML and has no other special meaning *)
                        stmtList    (* this is a regular variable in SML and has no other special meaning *)

        ) = M( stmtList, M(stmt, m) )  
        
        
        Note that the above M4 implementation will match ANY tree whose root is "stmtList" having three children.
        Such matches can be further constrained by explicitly exposing more of the tree structure.

            (3) the second child is a semi-colon
